Note: The EWPF is not part of the SANGOMA tools (directory) it is available at 
"workpackages/wp3/EWPF_code/SANGOMA CODE".
Since we do not want to copy the whole repository of SANGOMA intop OpenDA (1.5 Gb) we use a selection. 

The EWPF code is copied to $PWD/sangoma/EWpf
The sangoma tools are available as well in $PWD/sangoma/{Fortran,Matlab}

OpenDA specific code is stored in 
$PWD/sangoma/openda.
