Example models using RMI and Threading


Before you start the simulation you need to start the servers. For this we
have provided two scripts

start_rmi.sh : This script starts a single client. This script needs to be
               started before you can run lorenzSimulation.oda and
               lorenzEnkf.oda

start_rmi4.sh: This script starts 4 clients. This schript needs to be started
               before you can run lorenzEnkf4.oda and lorenzEnkf4.oda

NOTE: The clients will not stop. You have to terminate the processes manualy!

Tests:
lorenzSimulation.oda   Simulation with the Lorenz model. Model instances are
                       created on a single server.
lorenzEnkf.oda         EnKF with Lorenz model. All model instances are created
                       on a single server.
lorenzEnkf4.oda        EnKF with Lorenz model. the model instances are spread
                       over 4 servers.
lorenzEnkf4Thread.oda  Same as lorenzEnkf4.oda but now parallel model step
                       computations due to combination of RMI front-end model
                       with Thread front-end model.
