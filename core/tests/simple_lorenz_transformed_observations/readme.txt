This example/test contains a variant of the Lorenz model where observations of x^2, y^2 and z^2 are assimilated
with various Kalman filters. The aim is to test for models with nonliear observation operators.
This problem is very comply for filtering algorithms because the attractor is somewhat symmetric, which makes
it very difficult to distinguish -x from x.
