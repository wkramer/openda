Many algorithms will run multiple models as an ensemble or multiple attempts to compute a sensitivity for example. If these
runs can be carried out in parallel one can use multiple cores on one computer, then one can use multiple threads for this
purpose. Alternatives are mpi and rmi, which are also supported by OpenDA.
