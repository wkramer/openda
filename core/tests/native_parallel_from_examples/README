Parallel example model.
The polution model, can be run in parallel in two different modes
1) The worker-worker mode. The computational domain is split up over the worker
   processes.  OpenDA communicates with all these worker processes (at the same
   time) when a method is called.

2) The master-worker mode. One of the processes is the master processes (of the
   model) OpenDA only communicated with this process. The other processes are
   managed by the master process (of the model) OpenDA has no control/knowledge    on these processes.

Note: This is an simple example model that will probably run slower in parallel
      then it will do sequential


Quick start (run in worker-worker mode) 2 procs per model  :

mpiexec -np 3 Application.sh -p PolluteEnKFOpenDaConfig.oda

or 

mpiexec -np 1+2*Nproc Application.sh -p PolluteEnKFOpenDaConfig.oda
