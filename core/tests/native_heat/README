Native model, a 2 dimensional heat model.

This model directly implements the natice interface. It does not use the "simple model builder class" CTA_MODBUILD_SP for native models.

Since this is a native model, make sure that the dynamic libraries are on you 
%PATH% (Windows), LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Linux) or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (Mac).
