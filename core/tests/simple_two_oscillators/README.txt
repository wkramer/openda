Introduction

This test shows how to combine multiple scenarios for calibration of the same set of parameters.
Sometimes it is difficult to find one period of reasonable length that contains all relevant 
dynamics. One can think of multiple storms. A combination of these components into one cost-function
will make the parameter estimates more robust.

The tst in this example is very artificial and merely shows how to use this functionality in OpenDA.
