<h1>OpenDA installation for Windows users</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Note about 64-bit systems</h2>
Windows XP is a 32-bit operating system, but some versions of Windows Server, Windows Vista and Windows 7 are 64-bit operating
systems and can install the 64-bit version of Java. All native components of OpenDA are currently compiled for 32-bit versions of
Windows only. If you need these native components on a 64-bit system, you have two options:
<ul>
   <li>Install a 32-bit version of Java.</li>
   <li>Know how to compile the libraries yourself (<tt>.dll</tt>) and do so.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-step installation</h2>
<ol>
   <li>Ensure that Java version 1.6 or higher is installed on your computer, for instance by typing <i>java -version</i> on the
   command-line. In the unlikely case your Java version is too old, you can download the latest version from <a
      href="http://www.Java.com/download" target="_blank">www.Java.com/download</a></li>
   <li>Download OpenDA from <a href="http://www.openda.org" target="_blank">www.openda.org</a><br>
   </li>
   <li>Extract the OpenDA distribution file to the desired location on your computer.</li>
   <b>Note:</b> OpenDA does not work when it is installed on a location with a space in the path (like "...My Documents").
   <li>It is no longer needed to edit the startup bat scripts, as in previous versions of OpenDA.</li>
   <li>If you use the command line (cmd.exe) then it is probably convenient to add the directory bin within the OpenDA directory to the path (right-click om 'myComputer' and then 'advanced' then 'edit environment').</li>
</ol>
