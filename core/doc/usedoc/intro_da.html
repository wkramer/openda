<h1>OpenDA tutorial: Introduction to Data Assimilation</h1>

<hr>

Data assimilation is about the combination of two sources of information,
computational models and observations, in order to exploit both of their
strengths and compensate for their weaknesses.
<p>
Computational models are available nowadays for a wide range of
applications: weather prediction, environmental management, oil
exploration, traffic management and so on. They use knowledge of different
aspects of reality, e.g. physical laws, empirical relations, human
behaviour, etc., in order to construct a sequence of computational steps,
by which simulations of different aspects of reality can be made. 

<p>

The strengths of computational models are the ability to describe/forecast
future situations (also to explore what-if scenarios), and a large amount
of spatial and temporal detail. For instance weather forecasts are
run at ECMWF using a horizontal resolution of about 50 km for the entire
earth and a time step of 12 minutes. This is achieved with the tremendous
computing power of modern day computers, and with carefully designed
numerical algorithms.
<p>
However, computations are worthless if the system is not initialized
properly. &quot;Garbage in, garbage out&quot;. Further the &quot;state&quot; of a
computational model may deviate from reality more and more because of
inaccuracies in the model, aspects that are not considered or not modelled
well, inappropriate parameter settings and so on. Observations or
measurements are generally considered to be more accurate than model 
results. They always concern the true state of the physical system under
consideration. On the other hand, the number of observations is often
limited in space and in time.
<p>
The idea of data assimilation is to combine model and observations, and
exploit as much of the information contained in them.

<ul>
<li>off-line versus on-line;
<li>combine values: weights needed;
<li>statistical framework, std.error;
<li>deterministic versus stochastic models;
<li>noise model;
<li>data-assimilation on top of model.
</ul>
