<h1>OpenDA installation for Linux users</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Note about csh</h2>
At the moment, scripts for
<tt>csh</tt>
and related shells are not included with OpenDA. If is possible to use OpenDA in conjunction with for instance
<tt>tcsh</tt>
, but you will have to convert the scripts yourself.

<h2>Note about GNU C Library</h2>
All native components of OpenDA are compiled both for 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Linux. For
32 bit systems a GLIBC version 2.4 or higher is needed, for 64 bit version 2.7 or higher.

If you have an older version of GLIBC, you have to compile the libraries yourself. It is important
that you remove <b>all</b> .so bestanden in the lib-directory before building.

<h2>Step-by-step installation</h2>
<ol>
   <li>Ensure that Java version 1.6 or higher is installed in your computer. You can check what version is installed with <i>java
   -version</i>. We have only tested our software with the jre from SUN, with other jre's your mileage may vary. The easiest way to
   install Java is often with the package manager that comes with your distribution (e.g. <i>APT</i>, <i>yum</i> for Red Hat-, <i>dpkg</i>
   for Debian- or <i>YaST</i> for SUSE-related distributions).<br>
   </li>
   <li>Download OpenDA from <a href="http://www.openda.org/" target="_blank">www.openda.org</a>.
       There is a script available to perform this download: <a href="openda_checkout_sf.sh">openda_checkout_sf.sh</a></li>
   <li>Extract the OpenDA distribution file to the desired location on your computer. On some Linux systems unzip/ark is not
   installed by default, in that case try the package manager again.<br>
   </li>
   <li>A number of system variables need to be set before OpenDA can be run. The first variable that should be set is $OPENDADIR.
       This variable should point to the bin-directory of your OpenDA installation. For example:<br>
       <tt>export OPENDADIR=/myhome/openda/bin</tt><br>
       The other variables are set by the script <tt>settings_local.sh</tt> in the directory $OPENDADIR. This script will try to call the local
       script with machine specific settings $OPENDADIR/settings_local_&lt;hostname&gt;.sh. You must create this sript yourself.<br>
       Copy the <tt>settings_local_base.sh</tt> file to a new file
   named <tt>settings_local_&lt;hostname&gt;.sh</tt> in your $OPENDADIR (unless that file already exists). You can check your hostname with the <i>hostname</i>
   command. Then edit that file: enable the relevant lines and change the values of the environment variables. <br>
   For linux there is a default local settings script as well that might work out of the box for your system. You can use this script by<br>
   <tt>. $OPENDADIR/settings_local.sh linux</tt><br></li>

   <li>Most convenient is to set the varables automatically. Add in the <tt>.bashrc</tt> in your home directory, the following two lines:<br>
   <tt>export OPENDADIR=&lt;bindir&gt;</tt>, with <tt>&lt;bindir&gt;</tt> the location of the <tt>bin</tt> directory of your OpenDA
   installation.<br>
   <tt>. $OPENDADIR/setup_openda.sh</tt><br>
   Note that the '.' is significant in the latter of these lines.</li>
</ol>
