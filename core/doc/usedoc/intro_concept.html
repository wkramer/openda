<h1>Basic concepts of the OpenDA native components</h1>

<hr>

<h2>The overall goals</h2>

The overall goal of OpenDA is to provide a toolbox with data assimilation capabilities which may be added easily to existing
computational models:
<ul>
   <li>OpenDA should be applicable to a wide range of existing computational models.
   <ul>
      <li>complex, large-scale models should be supported as well as small scale test-models;</li>
      <li>the models may be implemented using various programming languages, particularly Fortran, C/C++, Java;</li>
      <li>the models may use parallel computing.</li>
   </ul>
   <li>It should be easy to get started, and one should quickly get initial results.</li>
   <li>One must be able to achieve good performance for large-scale models.
</ul>

<h2>The overall philosophy</h2>

<img src="figs/legocomponents2.jpg" width="99%">

<i>Basic design of the OpenDA system. Model and observation components (red/white bricks) are plugged into the core of the
OpenDA environment (yellow bricks), and can then exploit the available data-assimilation methods (grey bricks).</i>
</img>
<p>The basic design philosophy of OpenDA is illustrated in the figure. The key elements in this picture are:
<ul>
   <li>a deterministic or stochastic model (red/white bricks);</li>
   <li>a collection of observations (red/white bricks);</li>
   <li>several data assimilation procedures (the grey bricks);</li>
   <li>the core of the OpenDA-system that connects the different building blocks (the yellow bricks).</li>
</ul>
<p>The figure intends to illustrate a number of important points:
<ol>
   <li>in OpenDA, data assimilation is implemented on top of existing model software;</li>
   <li>the model and available observations need to be packaged in an appropriate way;</li>
   <li>the different parts of the complete application are strongly separated from each other.</li>
</ol>
Other aspects, which are not yet illustrated in the figure are:
<ol>
   <li>different &quot;model builders&quot; are provided for quickly packaging existing models and for combining separate
   models into larger ones;</li>
   <li>techniques from object orientation are used for providing a basic framework that may be optimized for efficiency.</li>
</ol>
<p>In OpenDA two <i>components</i> are defined: the OpenDA model component and the OpenDA stochastic observer component. There
can be multiple <i> instances</i> of each of these components, each with their own set of data. The set of routines to manipulate
the data is called the <i>interface</i> of the component. (Note: the terminology used in OpenDA with respect to object orientation
is described in the paragraph about <a href="#oo_terminology">OO terminology</a>).
<p>OpenDA defines the interface of the OpenDA model component. This consists of the list of methods/routines that a model must
provide. Examples are &quot;perform a time-step&quot;, &quot;deliver the model state&quot;, or &quot;accept a modified state&quot;.
This interface of the model component is visualized through the shape of the empty space in the yellow bricks in the figure above.
<p>Usually, existing model code does not yet provide the required routines, and certainly not in the prescribed form. Therefore
some additional code has to be written to convert between the existing code and the OpenDA model components interface. This is
illustrated in the figure using red and white bricks: the white bricks stand for the original model code, whereas the red bricks
concern the wrapping of the model in order to provide it in the required form.
<p>OpenDA similarly prescribes the interface of the OpenDA observation component. This is visualized using a second empty space
in the yellow bricks in the Lego figure. For using OpenDA for your model you must fill in this part, by wrapping the existing code
for manipulation of your observations and providing it in the required form.
<p>The data assimilation algorithms in the Lego figure cannot (yet) be seen as instances of another component. For now they are
merely routines that implement different data assimilation techniques with the elements provided by OpenDA as the building blocks
(models, observations, state vectors etc.). There is however a convergence to a fixed form, a more or less standardised argument
list for data assimilation algorithms, such that eventually these may be turned into a well-defined component.
<p>The basic design of OpenDA may seem disadvantageous at first, because it appears to require additional programming work in
comparison to an approach where data assimilation is added to a computational model in an ad-hoc way. This is usually not the case.
Most of the work in restructuring of the existing model code is needed in an ad-hoc approach too. This is because data assimilation
itself puts requirements on the way in which the model equations are implemented in software routines: one must be able to repeat a
time step, to adjust the model state, to add noise to forcings or the model state, and so on, which is often not true for
computational models that are not implemented with data assimilation in mind.
<p>The basic design does have a huge advantage over an ad-hoc approach for adding data assimilation to an existing program. It
is that the different aspects of a data assimilation algorithm are clearly separated. The algorithmics of the precise Kalman
filtering algorithm used are separated from the noise model, which in turn may be largely separated from the deterministic model and
the processing of observations. This makes it easy to experiment with different choices for each of the parts: adjusting the noise
model, adding observations, testing another data assimilation algorithm and so on. This is the major benefit of using the OpenDA
approach.

<h2>Contents of the OpenDA toolbox</h2>
</a> The yellow part in the Lego figure provides the infrastructure needed for connecting generic model and observation components to
generic data assimilation methods. We go into the contents of this part in order to gain a better insight in the structure and
working of the OpenDA system.
<p>The non-Java components of OpenDA are implemented using non-object oriented programming languages, particularly using Fortran
and C. (One reason for this is to avoid difficulties when connecting model software that is written in Fortran and C, another
motivation is the experience with Fortran and C of the original developers). However, OpenDA does use ideas from object orientation.
In particular the following terminology is used:
<ul>
   <li>An &quot;<i>object</i>&quot; is in OpenDA a variable in a computer program that cannot be manipulated directly, but only
   through the operations that are defined for it.
   <li>A &quot;<i>class</i>&quot; is the specification of a kind of objects. Objects are <i>instantiations</i> of the class to
   which they belong. The specification of a class describes both the data (properties, attributes) that objects of the class
   contain as well as the operations that may be performed.
   <li>The term &quot;<i>(software) component</i>&quot; is used in OpenDA to indicate classes which may involve a large amount
   of functionality. This concerns the &quot;OpenDA model component&quot; and the &quot;OpenDA (stochastic) observer
   component&quot;.
   <li>The &quot;<i>interface</i>&quot; of a class or a component is the set of routines that may be used to manipulate their
   instantiations.
   <li>An &quot;<i>OpenDA application</i>&quot; consists of a main program plus all the components, classes and other routines
   used. It may be packaged into a single executable, may be implemented using dynamic link libraries, or may be implemented in
   other forms as well.
</ul>
<p><i> Whereas the current OpenDA software and documentation often uses the word &quot;component&quot;, Wikipedia
(&quot;Component based software engineering&quot;, &quot;Class (computer science)&quot;) suggests that &quot;class&quot; would be
more appropriate in most cases, with exceptions for the model and observer components. We suggest to adhere to the terminology
introduced here.</i>

<i>Illustration of the use of object orientation in the OpenDA native components: objects are instantiations of OpenDA-defined
classes, are represented by object handles, and are manipulated using OpenDA-defined functions for the class.</i>
<p>As an example we consider the support for strings in OpenDA. A class <tt>CTA_String</tt> is provided for them. It is a simple
container for character strings, which is primarily introduced to shield the difficulties of sharing text strings between Fortran
and C. The operations provided for OpenDA strings are to create a new instance, set its value, concatenate strings, retrieve its
value, and cleanup a string when it is not needed anymore. A piece of code using this class is presented in the table above.
<p>Another basic class is the OpenDA time class, which provides a uniform way of handling time. The class registers a time span
(interval) and optionally contains a time step attribute. It may be extended in a future version with various time scales and
representations, time zones, etc..
<p>A third basic building block is the OpenDA vector class, which contains a dimension (length), the data type of the vector
elements (equal for all elements), and the values of the vector elements. An advantage of incorporating a vector class in OpenDA is
that it provides a generic entity on which data assimilation algorithms can be based, without unnecessarily restricting oneself to
the actual data type being used. Further, one can choose to provide different implementations (derived classes) of the vector class,
for instance a distributed vector (for parallel computing, sparse vector (if a significant amount of zeros may occur, or using an
optimized BLAS version.
<p>An important class in the OpenDA toolbox is the OpenDA tree. It is a generic class for grouping and structuring of data. It
may be compared to a &quot;struct&quot; in C or derived type in Fortran. One notable difference is that a OpenDA tree is a dynamic
entity: additional items may be added at run-time, with the names of the items provided as string arguments to the creation
routines. Therefore a OpenDA tree may also be compared to a file system; nodes contain OpenDA trees (like directories), and leafs
contain other OpenDA objects (like files).
<p>A special kind (derived class) of OpenDA tree is the OpenDA tree-vector. It is a OpenDA tree that contains only OpenDA
vectors as leaf elements. Of course it provides all the operations that a OpenDA tree class provides. Further it supports the
operations that a OpenDA vector is able to perform. The OpenDA tree-vector is important for instance for describing a model state.
In data assimilation one must be able to combine different model states much like vectors can be combined. However, representing the
model state by a single vector is a severe restriction for many computational models. It is preferable to be able to distinguish
different parts of the state, and sometimes needed to distinguish elements with different data types. Furthermore the hierarchical
nature of the OpenDA tree-vector supports composition of larger models states out of smaller ones as described later on.
<p>OpenDA primarily uses the XML-format for input/configuration-files. There are several facilities for quickly reading such
input-files. OpenDA trees (and tree-vectors) may be written to and read from XML-files as well.
<p>Interfaces are defined to the OpenDA classes for use in Fortran and C/C++. An interface for Java is defined separately in the
OpenDA project. This allows data assimilation algorithms to be implemented in Java, and be used together with model components made
in Fortran and C.
<p>The OpenDA toolbox can be installed on various Linux and Unix-platforms using the well-known <i>Automake</i> facilities. For
the Windows platform project files for Microsoft Visual Studio are provided.

<h2>Data assimilation methods and the OpenDA Application script</h2>

In the examples above OpenDA applications are created by writing a main program and calling OpenDA routines. In many cases it is
more convenient to use the OpenDA Application script instead. This is a generic main program that may be configured to use your
model, observations, and the requested data assimilation method.
<p>The OpenDA Application script uses an XML-file to create new OpenDA applications. The XML-file defines the three main
ingredients:
<ul>
   <li>The OpenDA model component to be used;</li>
   <li>the stochastic observer component to be used;</li>
   <li>the data assimilation method used.</li>
</ul>
The OpenDA Application script reads this configuration data, initializes the main model and observation components and then starts
the data assimilation algorithm. The assimilation algorithm performs the actual work, and finally the Application script shuts down
the computation.
<p>Within the field of data assimilation a distinction between off-line and on-line assimilation methods can be made. Off-line
data assimilation concerns model calibration, i.e. optimizing the parameters of a model such that the best fit with a set of
observations is obtained. 
<p>
In these methods the initial value of the model state may be considered as an input parameter of the model as well. This links the
3D-VAR and 4D-VAR variational approaches to the off-line methods listed above.
<p>On-line or sequential data assimilation methods consist of a cycle of forecast and analysis steps, where the methods
assimilates the data each time that observations become available. Optimal interpolation methods and Kalman filtering methods fall
into this class. 

<h2>The OpenDA stochastic model component</h2>

OpenDA uses a fixed form for a model component, in order to provide consistent terminology to both data assimilation methods and
model implementers. The general form of a OpenDA model is <br>
<tt>x(t+&Delta;t) = M(x(t), p, u(t), w(t))</tt><br>
Here <tt>x</tt> stands for the model state, <tt>t</tt> represents time, <tt>p</tt> is a vector of parameters, <tt>u</tt> concerns
the forcings of the model, <tt>w</tt> is the noise/uncertainty, and <tt>M</tt> is the model operator. Simpler forms of models are
possible, for instance a deterministic model without noise/uncertainty, a model without parameters or without forcings, and so on.
Although this does not turn a model into an invalid OpenDA model, it may limit the data assimilation techniques that can be applied.
<p>Data assimilation techniques will have to access the model state. This cannot be done directly. A model may use its own
representation of the state. The interface of the OpenDA model component however requires that a model be able to provide a copy of
the state in a OpenDA tree-vector, and that linear operations on a state-vector can be performed.
<p>Linear operations on the model state are an important aspect of the interface of the model component because these operations
are used frequently in data assimilation algorithms, and because the implementation may be dependent on the actual model that is
implemented. For instance a model may require positivity of specific quantities that it computes (e.g. waterdepth in a flow model),
such that blindly combining two state-vectors may give inappropriate results. Therefore a more careful combination recipe may be
implemented by the model itself.

<h2>The use of native model builders</h2>

The idea of OpenDA is to make it simple to get started, but to provide full flexibility as well. This is implemented by providing
default implementations where possible, but to also allow redefinition of the OpenDA components.
<p>One place where this idea is given concrete form is in the concept of model builders. A model builder is more or less a
template for creating new native model components. It fills in as many of the routines that must be provided, such that setting up a new
model component is greatly simplified. Once one is up and running one can then tune the implementation to ones own ideas.

<p>
<h3>The sp-model builder</h3>
The SP model builder (&quot;single processor&quot;) can be used to quickly create sequential (non-parallel) model components. This
model builder defines choices for the storage and administration of the state vector, model parameters, changes to the forcings, and
the noise parameters. With these choices made, a large portion of the methods that must be provided by a model component are
provided by the model builder already, and only a few model specific methods have to be filled in.

<p>
<h3>The parallel model builder</h3>
The parallel model builder is meant for computational models that use parallel computing, and which probably must be started in an
appropriate way. It is primarily meant for computational models that use MPI, which are based on multiple executables.
Parallelization using multi-threading, especially using OpenMP, can often be used in OpenDA using a direct approach, for instance
using the sp-builder.
<p>Note that parallelization of data assimilation methods can often be achieved in different ways. A data assimilation algorithm
often contains multiple model computations that may be performed in parallel, and each model computation itself may be parallelized
too. The former approach to parallelization is called <i>&quot;mode-parallel&quot;</i>. This name stems from the term &quot;error
modes&quot; that may be used for different model instantiations in certain Kalman filtering algorithms. The latter approach using
parallelization of the model computation itself is called <i> &quot;space-parallel&quot;</i>, which indirectly refers to the domain
decomposition approach. The two approaches may be combined as well, which gives a <i> &quot;mode and space-parallel&quot;</i>
approach.
<p>The parallel model builder is primarily concerned with space-parallelization. Mode-parallelization is already provided by the
sp-builder (&quot;using OpenDA, you get mode-parallelization for free&quot;). It is provided by the parallel model builder as well,
which yields the mode+space parallel approach.
<p>The architecture used by the parallel model builder is to use an SPMD-approach (&quot;single-program, multiple data&quot;),
i.e. to start the main OpenDA-application (executable) multiple times. Within the group of processes that is created in this way,
the first one acts as the master process. This process performs the data assimilation algorithm. The other processes perform the
model computations.
<p>Computational models that use a master-worker approach for their parallelization may fit well into this approach. The master
process of the original computational model may be integrated with the OpenDA master process. The subroutines that are required by
the OpenDA model components interface may be filled in using the routines of the model's master process. This may be achieved well
with the sp-builder.
<p>The parallel model builder is mainly concerned with computational models that are parallelized using a worker-worker
approach, e.g. using domain decomposition, where each computational process solves a different part of a global domain.
<p>The routines that are specified in the OpenDA model components interface, like &quot;perform a timestep&quot;, are
implemented differently in the master and worker processes. In the master process, these routines consist of sending MPI messages to
the worker processes, and waiting for the corresponding results. The results are joined together more or less the same as when
different sub-models are combined into a composite model.
<p>The worker processes read a configuration file from which they learn about their role in the global computation. Then they go
into &quot;worker-mode&quot;. This consists of an indefinite loop, waiting for MPI messages, and calling the appropriate model
routines. The model routines are implemented just like for a sequential model. One notable difference is that these routines are
called in all worker processes simultaneously, such that communication between the workers may be used.
<p>The parallel model builder provides the infrastructure needed for setting up this scheme. It provides the model routines for
the master process and the worker mode for the OpenDA main program. The model engineer just has to provide the model routines for
the worker processes.

<h2>The OpenDA stochastic observer component</h2>

In OpenDA an observation is not just a value, but contains all the information available for use in a data assimilation method. This
involves for instance information on the measurement error, which may be described by a probability density function. Other aspects
of observations are the type of quantity that is observed, the unit, time, grid location, and so on.
<p>The Stochastic Observer is the OpenDA component that holds an arbitrary number of observations. It may be instantiated
multiple times.

<p>A stochastic observer may be queried for a selection of the observations that it holds. For instance the observations within
a given timespan may be requested, for a selected set of &quot;stations&quot;, or that measure a specific quantity. Such a selection
may be used to create a new stochastic observer object.
<p>The stochastic observer further takes care of computing predicted values at observation locations. This concerns the
observation relation that is used in data assimilation algorithms: the model state is interpolated and/or converted to the
observation location and observed quantity. For this the implementation of a stochastic observer must know the structure of a model
state vector, the meaning of its components, and the procedures available for spatial and/or temporal interpolation. For this a
stochastic observer contains a substantial application dependent part.
<p>OpenDA provides default implementations of the stochastic observer and observation descriptions. In this default
implementation observations are stored in an SQLite3 database. The database contains two tables, &quot;stations&quot; and
&quot;data&quot; for time-independent and time-dependent information respectively. This default implementation provides a basis for
setting up ones own observation component. It should grow over time with features that are relevant to different computational
models.
