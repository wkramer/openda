<h1>Building the OpenDA native source code (Windows)</h1>

<hr>

This page describes how to build the OpenDA native source code on Windows computers. The source code is located in the
<tt>core\native</tt>
directory of the source distribution. The Microsoft Visual Studio solution file is located in the <tt>costa_vs2008</tt> subdirectory.

<h2>Note about Microsoft Visual Studio and Intel Fortran</h2>

The solution and project files provided are for the following version of the development environment:
<ul>
<li>vs2008 and Fortran 11.0 or higher</li>
</ul>
When you use a newer version of mentioned tools, it is fine to upgrade these files to your version.
In case you are working from the repository, please do not check in these upgraded files.

<h2>Building step-by-step</h2>

<ol>
<li> Load the solution file <tt>core\native\costa_vs2008\costa_core_vs2008.sln</tt> into Microsoft Visual Studio.</li>
<li> Select whether you want to perform a <tt>Release</tt> build or a <tt>Debug</tt> build.</li>
<li> Start the build process with <tt>Build All</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Note about the Intel Fortran library path</h2>

In some installations of Microsoft Visual Studio, the Intel Fortran library path is not added to the library path during the installation (and integration) of Intel Visual Fortran.
This will lead to a link error about one or more missing libraries, usually <tt>ifconsol.lib</tt>,
<p>
If this is the case, solve it by either:
<ul>
<li>Add the <tt>lib</tt> directory of the Intel Fortran installation to the global library path in Microsoft Visual Studio. This path can be found in Visual Studio menu path <tt>Tools/Options/Projects and Solutions/VC++ Directories/Library files</tt>.</li>
<li>Add the <tt>lib</tt> directory of the Intel Fortran installation  to the project's (probably <tt>libcta</tt>'s) library path. This path can be found the project's right-click menu: path <tt>Properties/Configuration Properties/Linker/General/Additional Library Directories</tt>.</li>
</ul>
