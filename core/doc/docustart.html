<h1>Welcome to the OpenDA documentation</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

OpenDA is a generic environment for parameter calibration and data assimilation application. It provides a platform that allows an
easy interchange of algorithms and models.
<p>It is a modular framework, containing methods and tools that can be easily applied to a wide range of applications. It allows
reuse of data assimilation software, thus reducing the costs of applying data assimilation methods. At the same time, it allows new
developments in the field of data assimilation to quickly spread to all applications that might benefit from it.
<p>We assume that the reader is familiar with computational modelling, and with the main aspects of data-assimilation: the
distinction between off-line and on-line methods, the statistical framework used, the notions of deterministic and stochastic
models, and the general structure of filtering methods.

<h2>Installation</h2>

The first thing that needs to be taken care of is the installation of OpenDA. Read the appropriate installation page to see how it's
done and whether it's done properly. We offer installation pages for <a href="usedoc/installation_linux.html" target="docu">Linux</a>,
<a href="usedoc/installation_mac.html" target="docu">Mac</a> and
<a href="usedoc/installation_windows.html" target="docu">Windows</a>.

<h2>Using OpenDA</h2>

The next step will be learning how to start using OpenDA. <br>
At first, a brief <a href="usedoc/intro_da.html" target="docu">introduction to data assimilation</a> is presented. <br>
The next step is an <a href="usedoc/tutorial_intro.html" target="docu">introduction to OpenDA</a>. <br>
After these introductions, you should be ready to <a href="usedoc/tutorial_start.html" target="docu">start OpenDA</a>, either from
the command-line or the <a href="usedoc/tutorial_gui.html" target="docu">graphical user interface (GUI)</a>. <br>
Some <a href="usedoc/tutorial_examples.html" target="docu">examples</a> are presented to see how it works. <br>
OpenDA is configured using XML files. For instance, if you would like to use a different calibration algorithm
or a stochastic observer, or if you would like to couple your own model to OpenDA, you should provide all necessary
settings, file names, variable names etc. to OpenDA in XML input files. The format of the XML files is specified
in XML schemas (.xsd) files that are deposited on this website. The diagrams describing the format of the XML schemas
are found <a href="xmlSchemasHTML/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2>Developers' corner</h2>

For people who want to (or have to) start from the OpenDA source code, the Developers' corner is added. The developers' corner is
split in two parts: a Java section and a native section. The term
<i>native</i>
is used for parts of the source code that need to be compiled to a specific platform (Linux, Mac or Windows), formerly known as the Costa PSE.
